# Fast to the End

Fast to the End is an engaging platformer game developed in Python using the Processing environment. This project marks my first significant foray into programming. 
* I focused on leveraging object-oriented programming to create versatile building blocks, such as various platform types, rather than concentrating on elaborate level design. By establishing a solid foundation of reusable components, I can now efficiently and easily build intricate levels if I want to.

### The Story
Your hero is fasting. As such, he must dodge all the different foods. You win when you collect all five hasanaat (good deeds). These are hard to miss; they're glowing star-thingies. Every time, you come in contact with a food, you lose some health. Your score will be the time it takes you to win: the less time, the better.

### Setup

- Download Processing 3.5.4 from the [Processing website](https://processing.org/releases)
- Clone this repository: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  ```
- Open the project in Processing: launch Processing, navigate to the File menu, and open the FastToTheEnd.pyde file using the 'Open' option
- Run the sketch by clicking the 'Run' button (triangle in the top-left corner) in Processing
